# Simple MVC Exploration

So doing a simple site for my son and of course instead of sticking up a html website and calling it a day I decided to explore a bit. Repo of two libraries I was using together to create routing and templating much like I am use to in laravel. Simple solution and still messing with it. Feedback encouraged.

## Libraries used

- Toro [https://github.com/anandkunal/ToroPHP](https://github.com/anandkunal/ToroPHP)
- Twig [https://github.com/twigphp/Twig](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig)
